**How it works**
- Simply rate the movies in the list from 1 to 10. 1 is the lowest rating and 10 is the highest, or ou can leave it "No rating".
- The engine will calculate based on your ratings and give you a list of recommended movies.


## Description
In this capstone, I work with data for movies, including ratings, similar to how how Netflix or
Amazon Prime Videos websites. The principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, 
and more. <br />
Write a program to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to 
a user based on their ratings of several movies.


## Outcome
1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
